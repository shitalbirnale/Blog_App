# Blog_App
#This application is made by using .Net Core MVC and SQL SERVER and Entity framework-code first approach.
#For the code-first approach we used Add-Migration and Update-Database commands to create a database based on Models.
#In this app we can upload new blog posts view all blog posts and use cards to show blog posts as well
